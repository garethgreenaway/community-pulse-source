Description = "Jason, Mary, and PJ sit down to talk to [Kim Bannerman](http://twitter.com/kmbannerman) and [Eamon Leonard](http://twitter.com/eamonleonard) about how to start a community. We meander down that topic while exploring the rabbit holes of burnout, dealing with difficult community members, who actually makes up a community, what separates a leader from a participant, and more."
