"Bio": "Ignite events are fun, fast-paced, series of presentations where speakers gather to share their knowledge and passion. Each speaker gets exactly five minutes, backed by 20 slides that advance automatically every 15 seconds. Talks cover a wide range of (often geeky) topics. Ignite has been in over 300 cities.
Created in 2006 by Brady Forrest and Bre Petis, this phenomenon has spread to hundreds of cities in countries across all 7 continents."
